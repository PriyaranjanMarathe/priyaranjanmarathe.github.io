1. Ajay Shah and Amit Varma did a marathon podcast recently. It runs over 10.5 hours.
2. The podcast highlights Ajay’s erudition and Amit’s awesomeness when it comes to asking good probing questions.
3. There are many takeaways from the discussion, and I intend to do a further deep dives into them. I estimate that these deep downs would be a year long project, and I would have barely scratched the surface.
4. I started today with the xkdr package created to analyse night time data.
5. I have been started asking chatGPT few probing questions when I start reading a book, learning a new technique or planning to invest more than 2 hours on a new endeavour. I think it’s a cool trick to estimate how much time I would need to invest to learn the new technique and would help me to ask good questions. So started with [this](https://chatgpt.com/share/6738ef84-aad8-8013-975a-8ad78f276a39) today. I would try to bounce my ideas and intent “Sankalp” with the authors and see if there is any collaboration opportunity here.
6. I am looking to use this blog to report my progress. Wish me good luck. As one might guess this idea is highly inspired by Simon Williamson. I can’t thank him enough.
