This setting is a life saver on Windows 11 :)

**Adjust Windows Mouse Settings**:

- Go to **Settings** > **Devices** > **Mouse**.
- Look for an option labeled **"Choose how many lines to scroll each time"** or something similar.
- Reduce the number of lines it scrolls. Setting it to 1 or 2 lines might help slow down the scrolling speed in SQL Server.
