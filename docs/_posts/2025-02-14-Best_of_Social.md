## Polars

I have been using Polars for over a year now. They are fast and particularly useful with formats such as parquet. Polars launched a GPU version last year, and I had the opportunity to review it last week.

I think because it was "loaded" in my working memory, I found Zach Wilson write about it.

Itâ€™s critical what we "load" in our working memory.

And of course, someone has the same question as me and posted it on Reddit a long time back ðŸ˜€

## Manapman Diaries

I wholeheartedly welcome remakes, "inspirations" of classics like the Manapman. Subodh Bhave, Rahul Deshpande, Shankar Mahadevan deserve kudos for taking the treasure of Marathi Natyageets and giving them a new makeover.

Sharing PuLa Deshpandeâ€™s rendering of _Mala Madan Bhase Ha_ and _Chandrika Hi Janu_.

And I loved Sonu Nigamâ€™s _Chandrika_ as well.

_Harawa Mora_ sung by Mahesh Kale in Bori, Goa. Bori is the birthplace of the great Marathi poet Ba Bha Borkar.

_Karoo Na Yaad Magar_ is particularly interesting.
