Noting some pet peeves. Hopefully some resonate well with others on the Internet as well.

1. Using a “k” instead of “Okay”. I wonder what people do with the time they save by typing a “k” instead of an “Okay”
2. “10 years” and the “Peter Norvig” camp. Yeah, I get the point but that # should not be a deterrent for anyone to start something new. How am I going to know if I am going to do something about it? I have been thinking about this a lot; lots since the last 5 years. [Here is the link to the Norvig essay](https://norvig.com/21-days.html)
