1. [Simon Willison](https://simonw.substack.com/p/civic-band-scraping-and-searching) shared information about "Civic Band" which scraps and searches PDF meeting minutes from hundreds of municipalities. There are so many use cases to think of here.
2. [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/20/foursquare-open-source-places/) shared information on Foursquare sharing information about 100mm+global places of interest. Combining his approach with [Ajay Shah's approach here](https://www.xkdr.org/paper/foundations-for-nighttime-lights-data-analysis)can be an interesting project. Lots to do.
3. [Why there are many Indias in India?](https://x.com/jsensarma/status/1816009178315366631?s=46) A Twitter thread that answers why so many Silicon Valley VCs spend time celebrating year end strategy planning meetings in Bagalore and so many Indian engineers want to immigrate to the West?
4. [Arnab Gupta](https://x.com/championswimmer) shared an interesting link about creating [own translator tool](https://x.com/championswimmer/status/1860089717242626269).
5. [James Holland](https://x.com/james7holland/status/1860284915117339084?s=46) on the demise of the “left” ideologies from the left, liberal parties. One is reminded of the Bombay Club and [Rahul Bajaj](https://www.business-standard.com/article/opinion/bhupesh-bhandari-once-there-was-the-bombay-club-111070800048_1.html) in particular.
6. Important to see BJPs win in Maharashtra today with the angle of Modi being [PM of Gujrat](https://thewire.in/government/in-past-ten-years-a-gujarat-heavy-pmo) Also Modi and Morarji Desai may be from two different ideologies, but sang the same song of “betterment of invested capital in Gujrat.”
