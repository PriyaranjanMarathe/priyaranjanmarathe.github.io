This holiday season, I immersed myself in Mala Umajlele Bal Gandharva, Kumar Gandharva’s brilliant interpretation of the legendary Bal Gandharva’s gayaki. The album, introduced by Pu La Deshpande, offers profound insights into why Kumarji undertook this exploration.

I wanted to document the 15 Natyageet from the program—each a masterpiece of Marathi musical theatre, carrying echoes of devotion, emotion, and drama.

The 15 Songs:
1️⃣ Swakul Tarak Suta – A devotional praise of Lord Rama’s kingdom.
2️⃣ Khara To Prema Na Dhari – Love’s purity versus greed (Manapman).
3️⃣ Nath Ha Mazha Mohi Khala – A Yaman-based tribute to Krishna (Sangeet Saubhadra).
4️⃣ Tata Kari Duhitavinasha – A call for protection and strength.
5️⃣ Prabhu Maja Vari Kopala – Sindhu’s lament over Sudhakar’s downfall (Ekach Pyala).
6️⃣ Narawara Krishnasaman – An ode to Krishna (Swayamvar).
7️⃣ Sujan Kasa Ha Mana Chori – Another gem from Swayamvar.
8️⃣ Mala Madan Bhase Ha – Featuring Pu La Deshpande’s harmonium magic.
9️⃣ Prema Nacha Jayi – A lesser-heard beauty.
🔟 Kashi Ya Tyaju Padala – The song tied to Antu Barwa’s famous scene (Ekach Pyala).
1️⃣1️⃣ Satya Wade Vachanala – A reflection on truth.
1️⃣2️⃣ Nayane Lajawita – A mesmerizing Manapman classic.
1️⃣3️⃣ Karin Yadumana Sadana – As Pu La quipped, "even a cat sings in this Natak!"
1️⃣4️⃣ Nacha Mansa Asha – A song I struggle to connect with. Maybe I need to listen more?
1️⃣5️⃣ Prabhu Aji Gamala – A stunning Bhairavi from Ekach Pyala—one that takes me back to a family memory.

A Final Thought
Kumarji’s selection is intriguing. Why only these 15? What could he have added? Excluded? And most of all, the choice of the word "Umajlele"—so fitting.

I’d love to hear your thoughts—what’s your favorite Natya Sangeet? Did Kumarji’s curation resonate with you? 🎶👇
