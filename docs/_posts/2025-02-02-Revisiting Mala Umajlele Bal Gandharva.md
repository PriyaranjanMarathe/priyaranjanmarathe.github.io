# Revisiting *Mala Umajlele Bal Gandharva* üé∂üé≠  

This holiday season, I immersed myself in [*Mala Umajlele Bal Gandharva*](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=JrL37c5evVs&si=pH3jM1H8Q6p4rsfZ), Kumar Gandharva‚Äôs brilliant interpretation of the legendary Bal Gandharva‚Äôs *gayaki*.  

Pu La Deshpande‚Äôs introduction to the program is thought-provoking. He outlines why and how Kumarji wanted to explore more about Bal Gandharva‚Äôs music. It‚Äôs worth paying close attention to.  

I‚Äôve meant to make a note of the songs sung in this program, as it gives me an opportunity to revisit these great masters.  

## The 15 Songs üéº  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Swakul Tarak Suta**  
   Kumarji starts with this song. The opening lines, *"Sukhavila nach Janak na Mata, Aishi kanta narkarata"*, mean that Lord Rama's kingdom is full of happiness, and even his parents, King Dasharatha and Queen Kausalya, dance in joy to songs in his praise.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **[Khara To Prema Na Dhari](https://aathavanitli-gani.com/Song/Khara_To_Prema_Na_Dhari)**  
   A *Natyageet* from *Manapman* with a central theme of the purity of love and the dangers of succumbing to greed. The song emphasizes that true love cannot be tainted, just as the sun continues to shine despite external influences.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **[Nath Ha Mazha Mohi Khala](https://youtu.be/qfo89r7pRX4?si=5kkYiAqiNCuRd_4W)**  
   Based on the *Raga Yaman* bandish *Harawa Mora*, this song, from *Sangeet Saubhadra*, is Rukmini‚Äôs praise of Lord Krishna. It reminds me of how [Mahesh Kale](https://twitter.com/maheshmkale) sang both *Harawa Mora* and *Nath Ha Mazha* in Charlotte (2016).  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **[Tata Kari Duhitavinasha](https://aathavanitli-gani.com/Song/Taat_Kari_Duhita_Vinasha)**  
   I couldn‚Äôt find the exact meaning of this song online. It seems to be a call asking for protection and strength. I hope to translate it soon.  

5Ô∏è‚É£ **[Prabhu Maja Vari Kopala](https://youtu.be/DkS1pkKpILY?si=3O5oBQKejKSxUstZ)**  
   In this song from *Ekach Pyala*, Sindhu believes that Sudhakar‚Äôs alcoholism is the result of divine wrath. Also, a periodic reminder from [Huberman Lab](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab) on why alcohol is harmful!  

6Ô∏è‚É£ **[Narawara Krishnasaman](https://youtu.be/qfo89r7pRX4?si=5kkYiAqiNCuRd_4W)**  
   A famous song from *Natak Swayamvar*. I was lucky to hear [Malini Rajurkar](https://twitter.com/malinirajurkar) perform it live at Sawai Gandharva Mahotsav in Pune (2008).  

7Ô∏è‚É£ **[Sujan Kasa Ha Mana Chori](https://youtu.be/qfo89r7pRX4?si=5kkYiAqiNCuRd_4W)**  
   Another famous number from *Swayamvar*. Found [this video](https://youtu.be/qfo89r7pRX4?si=5kkYiAqiNCuRd_4W) of Anushka Thali performing it.  

8Ô∏è‚É£ **[Mala Madan Bhase Ha](https://youtu.be/qfo89r7pRX4?si=5kkYiAqiNCuRd_4W)**  
   From *Sangeet Manapman*. Featuring Pu La Deshpande‚Äôs harmonium magic.  

9Ô∏è‚É£ **[Prema Nacha Jayi](https://aathavanitli-gani.com/Song/Prem_Nach_Jai_Tethe)**  
   A song I hadn‚Äôt listened to much earlier.  

üîü **[Kashi Ya Tyaju Padala](https://aathavanitli-gani.com/Song/Kashi_Ya_Tyaju_Padala)**  
   From *Ekach Pyala*, this is the song *Antu Barwa* haggles with the ticket manager over during a play in Ratnagiri.  

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ **[Satya Wade Vachanala](https://aathavanitli-gani.com/Song/Satya_Vade_Vachanala)**  
   From *Ekach Pyala*, a powerful reflection on truth.  

1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ **[Nayane Lajawita](https://youtu.be/qfo89r7pRX4?si=5kkYiAqiNCuRd_4W)**  
   From *Sangeet Manapman*. Here‚Äôs [Farhan Amin singing Nayane](https://youtu.be/qfo89r7pRX4?si=5kkYiAqiNCuRd_4W).  

1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ **[Karin Yadumana Sadana](https://youtu.be/qfo89r7pRX4?si=5kkYiAqiNCuRd_4W)**  
   From *Sangeet Subhadra*. Like [Pu La Deshpande](https://twitter.com/pldeshpande) said, even a cat sings in this *Natak*! So many fantastic songs. I‚Äôm trying to get the meaning of the lyrics.  

1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ **[Nacha Mansa Asha](https://youtu.be/KLZKpJwyK7E?si=kp4pIvkOIg8pK-Df)**  
   My least favorite song from the album. Somehow, it doesn‚Äôt click. Maybe I should listen to it more?  

1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ **[Prabhu Aji Gamala](https://youtu.be/qfo89r7pRX4?si=5kkYiAqiNCuRd_4W)**  
   A wonderful *Bhairavi* from *Ekach Pyala*. My cousin sang this song the first time we met back in 2003. It was hard to find music back then. She plays piano now, and her brother is learning *khayal gayaan*.

## Final Thoughts  

A collection of 15 great songs. Would be interesting to learn why Kumarji chose only these 15. Which ones could he have added? Which ones could have been excluded?  

Lastly, his use of the word *"Umajlele"* is so apt. Loved it.
