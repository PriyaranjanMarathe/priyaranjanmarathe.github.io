### Kailash Nadh
Dr. Nadh left a lasting impression from his [Scalar Pod interview](https://youtu.be/Aawk_wg_VYY?si=5ASDGZfpKowt9uDv).  
His blog is equally impressive: [nadh.in/blog](https://nadh.in/blog/).  

His work on Malayalam has taught me so much about why it‚Äôs important to focus on "your domain" rather than engaging in chest-thumping nationalism like "Bharat Mata Ki Jay."  
Check out his work:

### P. Jayachandran
He passed away recently. A friend posted about his demise, and I got to know about this great artist.  
He recorded more than **16,000 songs**! [Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._Jayachandran).  

Everything in India is "huge." India is not for beginners.  
Here‚Äôs an essential playlist of his songs:

Songs with more than a million views would be the gateway.

### Sidewalk Salt Tips
How much sidewalk salt to use?  
[Reddit thread on Vancouver](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/s/d13Ip8X2pa)  

How much does it cost for a 20-foot sidewalk? Less than a dollar.  
It‚Äôs always best to shovel as soon as possible to avoid using salt altogether.

### A Guy and a Golden
An amazing way to tell a story. And when you‚Äôre a Golden, it‚Äôs a little easier to write one. He is amazing! ü§©

### Mantras and Music
A friend‚Äôs mantra was:  
*‚ÄúThere are always better things to do.‚Äù*  

Ranjan‚Äôs corollary:

My version is better üòÇ:
