# Simple but not easy

1. I was really impressed by one of the organizations we were working with and wanted to write a postive review on their website. When I checked out their website found that it wasn't updated beyond the basic boilerplate from wix.com. Thought that it isn't a difficult task in 2025. I am sure there are many such low hanging fruits everywhere though. 
2. One of the PHD students at Cambridge (I think) was also complaining about same thing. (Not having discipline to collect all notes at one place.) I agree with Bryan Caplan that economists thinking that everything optimal has already been done is wrong.
