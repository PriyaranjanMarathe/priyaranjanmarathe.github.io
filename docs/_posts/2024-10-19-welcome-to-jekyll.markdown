I am trying to get my hands dirty with Jekyll inspired from this blog post from [Andrej Karpathy][AndrejKarpathy]

So far I am loving it. The page generation is so fast. It warrants that I take a class on markdown format soon. Looking at [this][markdown tutorial link] tutorial for the same.

Updates

1. 9 November 2024 - Today it took me around 10 minutes to figure out ways to publish a new blog post from my Obsidian notes which are already in markdown formats. I had figure out some configuration settings with Jekyll. I want this time to be around 2 minutes next time I try to post a new blog post. Looking forward.
2. 9 November 2024 - I love the simplicity of Jekyll. One example - To schedule blog posts in the future, all you have to do is to rename the file/properties with a date in the future. Brilliant!
