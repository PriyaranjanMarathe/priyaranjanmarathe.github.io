1. **Agency vs Protests**
   1. Note - If the configuration works correctly, this post will be live in 2050, and I would have retired by now. 
   2. We saw King Soopers employees protesting this week. They were protesting last week as well. [Here] (https://kdvr.com/news/local/workers-at-these-denver-area-grocery-stores-will-be-on-strike-starting-thursday/) is the news that seems to be related to this topic. 
   3. I don't think this is the best way to spend one's energy though. Not in US in 2025 with unemployment rate of 4%. Enough said.
