# Being methodic

1. I recently worked with a friend's relative, who was reqesting referrals for job opportunities.
2. He listed the companies that had open positions, the job ids and links. He shared the list in a neat excel.
3. I was delighted to see his list and it took me only a few minutes to share his resume with my friends. I loved this attention to detail.
