1. I am noting down some points which might be useful for Desis (Asian Americans) looking to donate blood in the US.
2. There are some rules which make it difficult for us to donate blood in the US. But if one gets lucky and tries her level best she can still donate blood.
3. I have followed these rules in NC, OH and CO and was able to donate blood. They might differ in other states. "Red Cross" and "Vitalant" are the two NGOs I have donated blood with. I am not sure if there are more in other states. As far as I can tell these NGOs seem to have a "monopoly" on blood donations.
4. Following are the rules -
   1. You must have lived in the US for 3 continuous years or more.
   2. If you visit India every year or every two years you will most likely not qualify.
   3. After you have lived in the US for 3 continuous year, there should be at least 1 years gap between your last visit to India. I hear that this rule has been modified to 3 months now, but we have check with the donation NGO.
5. One reminder for everyone is "as one gets wiser, she has to remember to be hydrated and resting well before and after blood donation. :)"
