# TIL: Microsoft SQL Server Sparse Columns

1. Storage Efficiency: Saves space for columns with lots of NULLs.
2. Cost-Effective: Lowers disk usage & I/O.
3. Wide Tables: Regular limit is 1024 columns; with sparse, up to 30,000.
4. Performance: Boosts reads for sparse data; minor overhead on non-NULLs.
5. Column Sets: Group sparse columns into one XML column for easier access.
6. Microsoft SQL Server: The only major RDBMS with native sparse column support.
Comparable Concepts:
1. NoSQL: Cassandra/HBase use dynamic, inherently sparse schemas.
2. Other RDBMS: PostgreSQL (via JSONB/hstore) and Oracle (with compression techniques) can mimic sparse storage, but lack a direct sparse column feature.
