1. I used to follow Jayesh Lalwani's posts on Quora. Found an interesting article on [Planned Obsolescence](https://medium.com/@jayeshlalwani/planned-obsolescence-b2f3bfc7e7ce) from him.
2. [Pula Deshpande at @NJ](https://youtu.be/t-uqxOpoxUU?si=w2X2M7_OLF4QwjTY) [Gaurav’s thread on the same topic.](https://web.archive.org/web/20201003145252/https://twitter.com/gauravsabnis/status/1302204867767947264?s=19)
3. Ted Gioia’s [writing advise](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/i-give-the-worst-writing-advice-in) Ted Gioia is an excellent music critic and culture guru. His substack is awesome. Ted has a MBA and because of it I think his views on companies are unique and insightful. I remember his bold and correct predictions on Spotify and Substack. Dig them up if you are interested.
4. GOI tweeting about importance of [Geospatial data for India](https://x.com/mygovindia/status/1861800294113542217?s=46) [Takshashila Institute has a course on it](https://school.takshashila.org.in/ecc-geospatial) [Milan Janosov is a good follow on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milan-janosov?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=ios_app)
5. Interesting [Earth Observation starter pack on BlueSky](https://go.bsky.app/NTaULGx)
6. [The best-case scenario for Trump's second term](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-best-case-scenario-for-trumps) Noah Smith writes how a Trump presidency might turn out to be “normalish” just like his first term.
7. [ChatGPT makes sales calls?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/s/8GWpyeTPPX) this is an interesting use case. I asked chatGPT what more use cases like this she can think of?
8. [Kishori Amonkar explains the mix raga Kaushi Kannada](https://youtu.be/f-GblgptNq8?si=jTgFJpULYtxrmu1x) Listen to her explain what it takes to learn ICM. First 2-3 minutes. She had amazing rigor. I love her dedication to her art.
9. TIL the famous Marathi play writer Krishnaji Prabhakar Khadilkar worked with Lokmanya Tilak in Kesari and Maratha. See [here](https://cmsadmin.amritmahotsav.nic.in/district-reopsitory-detail.htm?7905) Came to know about it from the [release video of Marathi movie Manapman](https://youtu.be/gF_FMbB_tEU?si=r2478conGdfGWC4B) Also that Khadilkar was a great chess player. More [trivia](https://youtu.be/xPWJykID__E?si=9B72hw6xjKqVSTAx) Because of difficult economics of making a Marathi movie, hats off to team Manapman for taking the plunge and making this movie. It’s hard work, if one comes to think of it.[Have a look at more trivia on the music album inaguration of the movie](https://youtu.be/sYduh1iqWNg?si=1mB5bmwrlFJQR8o7)
