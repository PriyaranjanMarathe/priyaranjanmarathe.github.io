1. [Onion video](https://x.com/pitdesi/status/1853814397564858584?s=46) on over analysis of US elections. Great reminder on why there are better things to do in life. I am glad we choose to listen to music and go to bed at the regular time this Tuesday, instead of staying up like in 2020 and PM Modi’s election to office in 2014. We respect freedom and the democratic process but can’t make it “central” part of our worldview. Otherwise we are renting our headspace to exactly the wrong people we want to really.
2. [Helpful comparison of different cloud platforms' free tiers](https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2024/efficient-dl/) the following link shows the source from where I got this information. Thanks to my friend [Vineet](https://x.com/vjsinsights?s=21)
3. [Information on various cloud free tiers ](https://x.com/vjsinsights/status/1696125481706488286?s=61&t=S6NQsb0gNmgCNuY6X17PNQ)
4. [Marimo reimagines Python notebooks](https://x.com/rohanpaul_ai/status/1853966278433685679?s=61&t=S6NQsb0gNmgCNuY6X17PNQ) I want to follow this up with an actual setup up hello world. Would be a cool #Novemver2024 list item.
5. [Docling to convert PDFs to Markdown](https://x.com/rohanpaul_ai/status/1853963921629261920?s=61&t=S6NQsb0gNmgCNuY6X17PNQ)
6. More LLM Use Cases - [genAI Idea Generator](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nomad/comments/14iifi9/ten_ideas_per_day/) and [Navin’s article on idea generation](https://aiiq.substack.com/p/using-gen-ai-as-an-idea-generator)
7. [genAI question from 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningML/comments/17y8id7/what_aiml_to_use/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) it’s hard to believe that it’s been over a year that I started dabbling little with programming aspect of genAI. I had implemented generative AI in a competition we conducted for [CO Marathi Mandal](https://www.comarathi.org/) in 2022. This is one of the many advantages of following smart people like [Navin Kabra](https://x.com/ngkabra?s=21)on Twitter.
8. [Cremieux](https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1842024849012605281?s=46) compilation of interesting tweets from the user Cremieux on his one year anniversary.
