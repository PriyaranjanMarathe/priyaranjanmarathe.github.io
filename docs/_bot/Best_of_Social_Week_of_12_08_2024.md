1. [Debanking (and Debunking?)](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/debanking-and-debunking/) Lots to learn here. Also good understanding on how Joe Rogan's show really works?
2. [Marathons are still safer than driving](https://chatgpt.com/share/67587cf0-1704-8013-add0-f3fe4a004d5c) Every one in a while we read [such news](https://www.navhindtimes.in/2024/12/09/featured/bogmalo-dentist-dies-after-taking-part-in-marathon/) If one pays close attention to the numbers, one can easily understand that it's still safer to prepare and run a Marathon than driving. I would also suggest this [Ed Thorpe interview with Tim Ferris](https://tim.blog/2022/05/24/ed-thorp/)
3. [A primer on fundamental misconceptions about health care](https://randomcriticalanalysis.com/2020/01/31/i-created-a-primer-on-fundamental-misconceptions-about-health-care/) [Referenced from this Substack](https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/grading-the-worlds-shortest-manifesto) and [thoughts from Dr. Rohin Fransis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKjb3tJ4sD8) and while we are at it, because there is so much knowledge to had, I would point to [this article on SATs](https://randomcriticalanalysis.com/2015/11/25/no-the-sat-doesnt-just-measure-income/) I am slowly starting to understand why economists are one of the best paid professionals in US. Lots to understand.
4. [Cold email playbook](https://www.za-zu.com/blog/playbook) interesting toolset for someone looking to grow her startup.
5. [Recurse manual](https://www.recurse.com/manual)
6. [The GPU is not always faster](https://cowfreedom.de/#dot_product/introduction)
